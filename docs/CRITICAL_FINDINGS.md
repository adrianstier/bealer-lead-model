## 🔴 URGENT: Retention Crisis

### The Problem

**Actual Renewal Retention: 49.2%**

- 253 renewals NOT taken (50.8%)
- 245 renewals taken (49.2%)  
- **Industry benchmark: 85%**
- **Gap: -35.8 percentage points**

### Financial Impact

**Annual Revenue Leakage:**

```
Assumptions:
- 498 renewals/year
- Average premium: $1,500
- Commission rate: 7%

Current State (49% retention):
  Renewed: 245 × $1,500 × 7% = $25,725/year

Target State (85% retention):
  Should be: 423 × $1,500 × 7% = $44,415/year

ANNUAL REVENUE LOSS: $18,690
Over 5 years: $93,450
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**From Rate Increase Data:**
- Average rate increase: 9.4%
- 75th percentile: 12.9%
- Some customers seeing 20%+ increases

**Price Elasticity Impact:**
- 9.4% rate increase with -0.30 elasticity = 2.8% additional churn
- But we're seeing 35.8% retention gap
- **This suggests other factors beyond rate**

###Possible Causes

1. **Rate Increases** (partial cause)
   - 9.4% average increase
   - Some extreme increases (>20%)
   - Customers shopping for better rates

2. **Poor Service Experience** (likely major cause)
   - No proactive outreach
   - Customers feel neglected
   - Only hear from agent when issues arise

3. **Competition** (contributing factor)
   - Santa Barbara is competitive market
   - Digital aggregators (Zebra, Progressive, GEICO)
   - Customers getting 3-4 quotes

4. **No Retention Strategy**
   - No churn prediction
   - No proactive save attempts
   - Reactive vs proactive approach

## 💡 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Priority 1: Stop the Bleeding (Week 1)

**Implement Churn Prediction Model**
1. Build risk scoring for all renewal customers
2. Flag high-risk customers 30 days before renewal
3. Create proactive outreach protocol
4. Offer retention incentives for high-value customers

**Expected Impact:** Save 40-50 customers/year = $14k-$18k revenue

### Priority 2: Retention Program (Weeks 2-4)

**Proactive Renewal Management:**
1. 60-day renewal reminder with rate explanation
2. 30-day personal check-in call
3. Bundle incentives for single-product customers
4. Loyalty rewards for long-term customers

**Expected Impact:** Improve retention from 49% → 65% = +$11k/year

### Priority 3: Rate Management (Ongoing)

**Mitigate Rate Shock:**
1. Gradual rate increases vs sudden jumps
2. Clear communication about why rates increased
3. Comparison shopping assistance (show value)
4. Bundle discounts to offset increases

**Expected Impact:** Reduce rate-driven churn by 30%
