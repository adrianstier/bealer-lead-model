## 🎯 One-Minute Pitch (If Derrick Asks for a Summary)

> "Derrick, I've built a five-part AI system that will transform your agency. It predicts which leads will convert so you spend smarter. It automatically sends invoices to older customers who need paper. It catches cancellations before they happen. It builds relationships through personalized newsletters. And it targets your ideal customers on social media.
>
> Twelve weeks from start to finish. The result? Higher conversion, fewer cancellations, 20 hours a week freed up, and a clear path to hitting your variable comp goals. This is a complete growth engine that runs on autopilot while you focus on what you do best - serving customers and closing deals.
>
> Let me show you how it works..."
