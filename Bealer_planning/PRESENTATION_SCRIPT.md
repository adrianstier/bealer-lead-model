## Opening (2 minutes)

**[Show header section of website]**

**SAY:**
> "Derrick, thanks for taking the time today. What I want to show you is a complete blueprint for transforming your agency into an AI-powered growth machine.
>
> This isn't about replacing what you're doing well - it's about multiplying your existing efforts and protecting the business you've already built.
>
> The whole plan is laid out in this interactive website I've built for us. We can walk through it together, and you can refer back to it anytime. Should take about 30 minutes."

**PAUSE FOR ACKNOWLEDGMENT**

---

## Executive Summary (3 minutes)

**[Scroll to Executive Summary section]**

**SAY:**
> "Let me start with the big picture. You're operating in one of the best markets in California - Santa Barbara and Goleta have everything: high-value homeowners, retirees with money, tech professionals. The opportunity is massive.
>
> **[Point to 'The Opportunity' card]**
>
> But you're also facing some real challenges. Rates are going up, customers are getting frustrated, and manual processes that worked when you were smaller just don't scale anymore.
>
> **[Point to 'The Challenge' card]**
>
> What I'm proposing is a five-part AI system that handles the entire customer lifecycle..."

**[Point to the lifecycle flow]**

**SAY:**
> "...from the moment someone becomes a lead, all the way through to keeping them as a loyal customer for life. Attract, convert, protect, nurture, upsell, retain. And it all happens automatically, with AI running in the background."

**PAUSE - Ask:** "Make sense so far?"

## The Five AI Projects (15 minutes total - 3 min each)

### Project A: Lead Acquisition

**[Scroll to Project A card]**

**SAY:**
> "Let's start with leads. Right now, you're buying leads, but it's kind of a black box, right? You don't really know which zip codes convert best, which age groups are most likely to bundle, or how many leads you need to buy each week to hit your goals.
>
> **[Point to 'The Problem' section]**
>
> So here's what we build: an AI system that analyzes every lead you've ever received - outcomes, demographics, premiums, everything - and creates a predictive model.
>
> **[Point to 'AI Solution' section]**
>
> It tells you exactly which leads to focus on, predicts your conversion probability before you even call them, and - this is the big one - shows you exactly how many leads you need to buy to hit the next variable comp tier.
>
> Instead of guessing, you'll have a dashboard that says 'Buy 47 leads this week in zip code 93105, targeting homeowners aged 55-65, and you'll hit Gold tier by Q2.'"

**PAUSE - Check for understanding**

---

### Project B: Invoice Mailing

**[Scroll to Project B card]**

**SAY:**
> "Now, this one might seem simple, but it's actually a retention goldmine. You've got a ton of older customers, right? Retirees in Santa Barbara who have been with Allstate for decades.
>
> **[Point to 'The Problem' section]**
>
> These folks expect paper. They want an invoice in the mail, in an envelope, like it's always been. But Allstate is pushing everything digital, and that's causing confusion, missed payments, and cancellations.
>
> **[Point to 'AI Solution' section]**
>
> So we build a system that automatically downloads invoices every month, figures out which customers need paper based on their age and payment history, prints personalized letters and invoices, and gets them in the mail.
>
> Zero work for you or Britney. Happens automatically. And it prevents high-value customers from canceling over a $200 missed payment."

**PAUSE - Ask:** "How many older customers would you say you have who'd benefit from this?"

---

### Project C: Cancellation Watchtower

**[Scroll to Project C card]**

**SAY:**
> "Alright, this is the one that could save you tens of thousands in premium. Every week, you get a cancellation report, right? And you're supposed to review it, figure out who's saveable, reach out, try to keep them.
>
> **[Point to 'The Problem' section]**
>
> But realistically, you're busy. Things slip through. And you can't always tell which cancellations are worth the effort.
>
> **[Point to 'AI Solution' section]**
>
> This AI system downloads that report every Monday morning, analyzes every single pending cancellation, predicts who's most likely to stay if you reach out, categorizes them by urgency - red, yellow, green - and then automatically sends personalized texts and emails.
>
> You get a dashboard that shows you 'These 5 customers represent $12,000 in annual premium and are saveable. Here's the script to use when you call them.'
>
> It's like having someone whose only job is to monitor cancellations and make sure nothing falls through the cracks."

**PAUSE - Check reaction**

---

### Project D: AI Concierge

**[Scroll to Project D card]**

**SAY:**
> "Now we're getting into relationship building. Be honest - how often do your customers hear from you when nothing's wrong?
>
> **[Wait for answer]**
>
> Exactly. Most people only hear from their insurance agent when rates go up or there's a problem. That's not great for loyalty, especially when rates ARE going up.
>
> **[Point to 'AI Solution' section]**
>
> So we create an AI concierge that sends personalized communication automatically. Monthly newsletters tailored to each customer - a retiree in Santa Barbara gets different content than a young family in Goleta. Birthday messages. Renewal summaries in plain English, not insurance jargon. Post-claim check-ins.
>
> It's all generated by AI but sounds like it came from you. You review and approve the templates once, then it runs on autopilot. Customers feel valued and stay connected to your agency."

**PAUSE - Ask:** "What do you think about that approach?"

---

### Project E: Social Media Marketing

**[Scroll to Project E card]**

**SAY:**
> "Last piece: marketing. Right now, you're probably buying leads from traditional sources. But there's a huge opportunity on social media to target the exact people you want as customers.
>
> **[Point to 'AI Solution' section]**
>
> We use your existing customer list to build 'lookalike audiences' on Facebook, Instagram, Nextdoor, YouTube. The AI finds people who look just like your best customers - similar age, location, income, interests.
>
> Then it creates the ads, tests different versions, optimizes the budget, and brings you higher-quality leads at a lower cost.
>
> Instead of getting random leads from a call center, you're attracting people who already fit your ideal customer profile. Better conversion, better bundling, better lifetime value."

**PAUSE - Gauge interest**

---

## Timeline Review (4 minutes)

**[Scroll to Timeline section]**

**SAY:**
> "So you might be thinking, 'This sounds great, but how long does it take to build all this?'
>
> I've broken it into four phases over 12 weeks. Three months from start to finish.
>
> **[Point to Phase 1]**
>
> Weeks 1-3, we collect all the data - leads, customer info, cancellations, invoices - and I build the AI models. By week 3, the lead scoring model is ready and accurate.
>
> **[Point to Phase 2]**
>
> Weeks 4-6, I build working prototypes of all five systems. You can test them with sample data, give feedback, make sure everything looks right.
>
> **[Point to Phase 3]**
>
> Weeks 7-9, we go live. Everything's deployed, running automatically, and you start seeing results.
>
> **[Point to Phase 4]**
>
> Weeks 10-12, we optimize. Make the AI smarter, test different approaches, fine-tune everything.
>
> **[Scroll down to metrics]**
>
> And here are the key milestones. By week 12, you should see a 15-20% reduction in time spent on manual tasks, better conversion rates, and fewer cancellations."

**PAUSE - Ask:** "Does this timeline feel realistic to you?"

## Benefits Overview (2 minutes)

**[Scroll to Benefits section]**

**SAY:**
> "Let me show you what this means for your business.
>
> **[Point to each benefit card as you speak]**
>
> **Business Growth:** Predictable lead generation, higher conversion, more bundling, clear path to higher comp tiers.
>
> **Retention:** Fewer preventable cancellations, stronger relationships, happier customers.
>
> **Operational Efficiency:** 20 hours a week freed up. That's time you can spend on actual sales or strategic planning instead of administrative work.
>
> **Customer Experience:** Every customer feels like they're your only customer. Personalized, proactive, local.
>
> Bottom line: this is about making more money, keeping more customers, and working less on things that don't require your expertise."

## Data Requirements (2 minutes)

**[Scroll to Data Requirements section]**

**SAY:**
> "To make this work, I need data from your agency. And I'll be straight with you - this is the hardest part, but it's a one-time lift.
>
> **[Click through checklist categories]**
>
> We need customer data, lead data, cancellation reports, billing info, marketing assets, and some business metrics.
>
> Most of this you already have. Britney can help pull it from your systems. Some of it might need to be exported from Allstate's platform.
>
> **[Click a few checklist items to show interactivity]**
>
> I've made this whole thing interactive - you and Britney can use these checkboxes to track what's been collected. Every item you check off gets us closer to launch."

**PAUSE - Ask:** "Do you have access to most of this data, or is there anything that seems hard to get?"

---

## Next Steps (2 minutes)

**[Scroll to Next Steps section]**

**SAY:**
> "So if you want to move forward, here's what happens next:
>
> **[Point to steps 1-4]**
>
> 1. You approve this plan - we're good to go.
> 2. We schedule a kick-off meeting with you, me, and Britney to start data collection.
> 3. I start building in week 1.
> 4. We do weekly check-ins so you always know where we are.
>
> **[Point to CTA box]**
>
> And remember - this isn't just a proposal. It's a complete blueprint. You can come back to this website anytime, share it with Britney, use the checklist to track progress.
>
> It's your roadmap for the next 12 weeks and beyond."

---

## Closing (1 minute)

**SAY:**
> "Look, Derrick - you've built a great agency. You know your market, you know your customers, you're doing well.
>
> But the insurance industry is changing fast. The agents who win in the next 5 years won't be the ones who work the hardest - they'll be the ones who work the smartest.
>
> This system gives you superpowers. You'll know more than your competitors, move faster than them, and deliver better experiences. And you'll do it all with less manual effort.
>
> What questions do you have?"

## Handling Common Objections

### "This sounds expensive."

**RESPONSE:**
> "I totally get that. Here's how I think about ROI: If this system helps you save just 10 policies a year that would have canceled - let's say average $2,000 premium - that's $20,000 in saved revenue. If it improves your lead conversion by even 15%, that could be another $30,000+ in new business. And if it helps you hit one higher variable comp tier, that's potentially a $50,000+ bonus difference. We're talking about six-figure annual impact. The investment pays for itself in months, not years."

---

### "I don't understand AI / This seems too technical."

**RESPONSE:**
> "You don't need to understand how it works under the hood - that's my job. From your perspective, you'll just see dashboards, get recommendations, and approve communications. It's like using Google Maps - you don't need to know how GPS satellites work to get directions. The AI handles the complex stuff, you handle the decisions."

---

### "What if my data isn't good enough?"

**RESPONSE:**
> "That's actually a common concern, but here's the thing: we work with what you have. If you've got 1 year of lead data, we start there. If you've got 3 years, even better. The AI gets smarter over time as we feed it more data. We're not looking for perfection on day one - we're building a system that improves continuously. Whatever data you have is enough to start."

---

### "I'm worried about compliance / Allstate approval."

**RESPONSE:**
> "100% valid concern, and it's built into the process. Every customer-facing communication goes through compliance review before it goes live. We follow all Allstate marketing guidelines. Nothing gets sent without your approval first. You're always in control. This is a tool that helps you do your job better - it doesn't replace your judgment or override Allstate's rules."

---

### "I need to think about it / talk to my partner."

**RESPONSE:**
> "Absolutely, that makes total sense. This is a big decision. Here's what I suggest: I'll send you the link to this website so you can review it again, share it with anyone you want to consult, and we can schedule a follow-up call next week. I'm also happy to answer any questions via email in the meantime. Take your time - I want you to feel completely confident before we move forward."

---

### "What happens after 12 weeks? Is this ongoing?"

**RESPONSE:**
> "Great question. After the initial 12 weeks, the systems run automatically. They don't require constant maintenance. But I do recommend an ongoing optimization and support plan - maybe a few hours a month - to keep improving the AI, adding new features, and troubleshooting if anything comes up. Think of it like maintaining a car - the initial build is the big investment, then there's just routine upkeep to keep it running smoothly."
