## ⚠️ What Went Wrong in Initial Analysis

### The Mistake

**Misinterpreted "Renewal Audit" report:**
- Renewal Audit shows 498 renewals DUE in October 2025
- 253 "Renewal Not Taken" = renewal OFFERS not accepted
- 245 "Renewal Taken" = renewed
- **This is NOT the same as overall retention rate**

**Why the confusion:**
- "Renewal Not Taken" sounds like lost customers
- But many of these are:
  - Customers who haven't decided yet
  - Renewals still pending
  - Not final churn

**Correct interpretation:**
- Renewal Audit = snapshot of renewals DUE that month
- Business Metrics = actual calculated retention over time
- 89.64% is the TRUE retention rate

## 📊 Actual Business Health

### Revenue Metrics (Oct 2025)

**Monthly Renewal Revenue:** $306,556
**YTD Renewal Revenue:** $3,350,891

- Commission (7%): ~$258k/year
