## ⚠️ GUESSING / ESTIMATED (Need Derrick's Input)

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Needed for Accurate Modeling

#### 1. **Policy Counts by Type** ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Why Critical:** Determines cross-sell opportunities, bundling analysis, 1.8 threshold path

**Currently Guessing:**
- Auto: 1,800 policies
- Home: 1,200 policies
- Umbrella: 350 policies
- Cyber: 100 policies
- Commercial: 50 policies
- **TOTAL: 3,500 policies**

**Where Derrick Can Get This:**
- Applied Epic: Reports → Production → Policy Count by Type
- AMS360: Reports → Policy Reports → Book Composition
- EZLynx: Analytics → Book Analysis
- Even a rough breakdown is helpful!

**Quick Alternative:**
If he doesn't have reports, ask him to estimate percentages:
- "What % of my book is auto?" (~50%?)
- "What % is home?" (~35%?)
- "What % is umbrella?" (~10%?)
- etc.

---

#### 2. **Total Customers (Households)** ⭐ CRITICAL
**Why Critical:** Calculates policies per customer (1.8 threshold)

**Currently Guessing:**
- 2,200 customers
- Which gives: 3,500 policies ÷ 2,200 = 1.59 PPC

**Where Derrick Can Get This:**
- AMS: Look for "Households" or "Unique Customers" count
- If not available, ask: "How many unique households/families do I serve?"

**Why This Matters:**
- If actual PPC is already 1.8+: He's hitting the retention target! ✅
- If actual PPC is below 1.8: Clear cross-sell opportunity 🎯

---

#### 3. **Actual Retention Rate** ⭐ CRITICAL
**Why Critical:** Affects LTV, growth projections, and revenue forecasting

**Currently Guessing:**
- 91% annual retention (9% churn)
- Based on estimated 1.59 PPC

**Where Derrick Can Get This:**
- Look at policies from 12 months ago vs now
- Formula: (Policies Retained ÷ Starting Policies) × 100
- Or ask: "What % of my policies renew each year?"

**Example:**
- Jan 2024: 3,300 policies
- Jan 2025: 3,000 of those same policies renewed
- Retention: 3,000 ÷ 3,300 = 90.9%

---

#### 4. **Commission Rate** ⭐ CRITICAL
**Why Critical:** Determines revenue, EBITDA, all financial projections

**Currently Guessing:**
- 12% (typical for captive agency)

**What Derrick Should Know:**
- "What % commission do I earn on new business?"
- "What % on renewals?"
- May vary by product type (umbrella might be higher)

**This is usually in his contract or he can ask Straightlined**

---

### 🟡 IMPORTANT - Improves Accuracy

#### 5. **Monthly Marketing Spend**
**Currently Guessing:**
- Total: $4,000/month
- Referral: $2,000
- Digital: $1,000
- Traditional: $500
- Partnerships: $500

**Ask Derrick:**
- "How much do I spend on marketing per month?"
- If he tracks by channel, even better!
- If he doesn't spend much, that's fine - just tell us "minimal" or "$0"

---

#### 6. **Fixed Monthly Costs**
**Currently Guessing:**
- $12,000/month (rent, software, utilities, etc.)

**Ask Derrick:**
- Office rent: $_______/month
- Software (AMS, CRM, etc.): $_______/month
- Utilities, internet, phone: $_______/month
- Other overhead: $_______/month
- **Total:** $_______/month

---

#### 7. **Admin Salary**
**Currently Guessing:**
- $3,500/month ($42k/year)

**Ask Derrick:**
- What does he pay his admin assistant? $_______/month

---

### 🟢 NICE TO HAVE - Fine-Tuning

#### 8. **Average Premium by Product Type**
Currently using $1,164 blended average

If Derrick knows:
- Auto avg premium: $______/year
- Home avg premium: $______/year
- Umbrella avg premium: $______/year
- etc.

---

#### 9. **Commission Rate by Product**
If different rates for different products:
- Auto: _____%
- Home: _____%
- Umbrella: _____%
- Cyber: _____%

---

#### 10. **Technology Costs**
- AMS system: $______/month
- CRM: $______/month
- E&O Insurance: $______/month or /year
- Website/marketing tools: $______/month

## 🚀 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GET REAL DATA

Once Derrick provides actual numbers, I'll update:

1. ✅ All default values in the React app
2. ✅ derrick_agency_data.json file
3. ✅ Calculation formulas if needed
4. ✅ Benchmark comparisons
5. ✅ Growth projections

**The model will then show:**
- Precise ROI for hiring decisions
- Exact cross-sell opportunities
- Accurate break-even analysis
- Real capacity constraints
- True growth potential

---

## ❓ If Derrick Says "I Don't Know" or "I Don't Track That"

**That's totally fine!** Many solo producers don't track everything.

**Options:**
1. **Use current estimates** - Model still works, just less precise
2. **Make educated guesses** - "I think I have about X customers"
3. **We can calculate** - From premium and policy counts, we can derive a lot
4. **Set up tracking** - We can help him track these going forward

**The model is useful even with estimates - it just gets BETTER with real data!**

---

**Bottom Line:**

We're guessing at about 40% of the data. The **4 most important numbers** are:
1. Total policies
2. Total customers
3. Commission rate
4. Monthly overhead

**Everything else** we can estimate or calculate reasonably well.
