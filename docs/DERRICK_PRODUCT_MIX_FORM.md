## Where to Find This Data

Most AMS (Agency Management Systems) can generate reports showing:

### For Policy Counts by Type:
- **Applied Epic:** Reports > Production > Policy Type Summary
- **AMS360:** Reports > Policy Reports > Book Composition
- **EZLynx:** Analytics > Book Analysis
- **Salesforce Insurance:** Dashboard > Policy Distribution

### For Bundling Data:
- Look for "Household" or "Customer" reports
- Multi-policy household analysis
- Cross-sell penetration reports

### Quick Estimate Method (if no AMS report):
If you can't easily get exact counts, estimate based on premium:

**Example:**
- Total Written Premium: $4,072,346/month = $48,868,152/year
- If average premium is $1,164/policy
- Estimated total policies = $48,868,152 ÷ $1,164 = ~41,989 policies/year ÷ 12 months

This gives you a ballpark to work from.

## Why This Matters

Getting to **1.8 policies per customer** is THE critical threshold that unlocks:

✅ **95% retention** (up from 91%)
✅ **28% lower churn** (5% vs 9%)
✅ **Higher LTV** (customers stay longer)
✅ **Lower CAC** (better unit economics)
✅ **Compound growth** (retention compounds over time)

**Impact on your agency:**
- 2,200 customers × 1.8 policies = 3,960 policies (need +460 from current 3,500)
- If you add 460 policies through cross-selling (not new customers):
  - Retention improves from 91% → 95%
  - You retain an extra 88 customers per year (2,200 × 4%)
  - At $1,164 avg premium × 1.8 policies = $184k in saved revenue annually
